##Shared Club Account.

This is a GitHub account that is shared for a non-profit club in Auburn, CA called, cleverly enough, "The Computer Club".
We are using this account (affiliated loosely with the Hack Club) to support our effort to move our primary website from a Wordpress installation to a Hugo Static Site.

This change is only a function of the "hello-world" process of opening this account.
